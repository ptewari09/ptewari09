## 🔍 About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building meaningful technology and contributing to applied research.  
My work spans fullstack development, data analytics, and intelligent automation. I enjoy solving real-world problems — whether through clean code, system design, or research-backed experimentation.

Currently working on **Devure**, a developer resource tracking platform that helps learners find the best tools, courses, and open-source projects based on their goals.
